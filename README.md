## Abstract
In this project we had to create a server.js in order to get the users inputs (in this case the note title and the note itself) store it in the data base (db.json) also, to retreve the info from the db and present it to the user as command on the HTML.

## Content
1. DataBase folder with the db.json (storage)
1. node_modules (npm i)
1. public folder (frontend HTMLs and Styles)
1. package json (with express)
1. Server.js (command line to take or show the information)

## Learnins
The learnings from this project are siginificant in my programming development.
- In this project I learned how to create a server.
- How to make use of express package.
- How to use the Path var in order to use the __dirname so the sever can find the files on a more efficient way.
- How to state the get /note rout in order to send the notes.html file
- How to set the get /api/notes rout in order to read the info and transfer it as data then to conver it as json to finally be displyed.
- How to set the post /api/note rout in order to take the user input and store it on the db.json file.
- How to make use of the * rout in order to get the main index.html if the rout is misspeled
